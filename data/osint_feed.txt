Subject: New activity from ShadowNet group

We have observed new C2 servers being activated by the ShadowNet APT group.
One of the primary servers is located at 198.51.100.23.
They are using the domain evil-c2-server.net for communication.

Our malware analysis team has identified a new dropper with the SHA256 hash:
a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2c3d4e5f6a1b2

Another callback was observed to 192.0.2.10, but this seems to be a test server.
Please update your watchlists.
